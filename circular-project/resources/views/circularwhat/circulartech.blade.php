                <p>The tech industry is one of the biggest on the planet, and not surprisingly the most demanding when it
                    comes to resources.</p>
                <p>A great deal of these resources are in limited amount or difficult to obtain. It is the industry's coming
                    challenge to find a way to tackle this issue with a new way of recycling their products to be able to
                    re-use these precious materials in their new high-end technologies. But will they succeed?</p>
