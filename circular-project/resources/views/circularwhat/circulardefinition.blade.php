                <h1>What is circular economy?</h1>
                <p>The circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing,
                    repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. In this way,
                    the
                    life
                    cycle of products is extended.</p>
                <p>It entails markets that give incentives to reusing products, rather than scrapping them and then
                    extracting new resources.</p>
