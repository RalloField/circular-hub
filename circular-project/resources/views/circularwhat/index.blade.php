                <p>The circular economy is a model of production and consumption, which involves sharing, leasing, reusing,
                    repairing, refurbishing and recycling existing materials and products as long as possible. In this way,
                    the
                    life
                    cycle of products is extended.</p>
                <p>It entails markets that gice incentives to reusing products, rather than scrapping them and then
                    extracting new resources.</p>

                <p>The tech industry is one of the biggest on the planet, and not surprisingly the most demanding when it
                    comes to resources.</p>
                <p>A great deal of these resources are in limited amount or difficult to obtain. It is the industry's coming
                    challenge to find a way to tackle this issue with a new way of recycling their products to be able to
                    re-use these precious materials in their new high-end technologies. But will they succeed?</p>
